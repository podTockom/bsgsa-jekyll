# Suggested courses

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> See below for course numbers of relevant seminars!

Note that not all courses presented here are still offered and not all courses that are "relevant" are included in this list (i.e. some information is outdated or incomplete).

<!--Registered users only: more information on relevant courses is available [[Main.CourseReviews][here]]. -->

## First semester recommendations

* MA students:
    * Students seeking the Master of Arts degree usually need to take STAT 201A (probability) and STAT 201B (statistics) if they haven’t taken masters-level probability and statistics before. During the first fall semester, students usually take one additional class, which could be PB HLTH 252D (causal inference) or any of the PB HLTH 240 series (B: survival analysis; C/D: computational biology, etc.). PB HLTH 252D is offered every fall semester. PB HLTH 240B,C,D are offered every other year during the fall semester. STAT 243 (statistical computing) is also a good choice, which is offered every fall semester.
    * For students with less stat/math background who may find STAT 201A/B too difficult, STAT 134 and STAT 135 are good substitutes. Also, STAT 133 is a good alternative to STAT 243 for students with less programming experience.
    * Other notes:
        * Enrollment in STAT 201A, 201B, and 243 can be problematic since they are reserved for statistics master's students. Simply go to talk to the professors at the first day of class if you are not able to enroll due to the restriction.
        * STAT 134, 135 are also hard to enroll in due to their popularity.
        * There will be a background quiz at the beginning of STAT 201A. It covers basic probability concepts. For example, calculating expectation and drawing a standard normal curve.

## Seminars

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Seminars are typically worth 2 credit hours and often involve minimal time commitment but high levels of exposure to advanced topics in a low-pressure environment.  Many can (or must) be taken pass/fail.  Some seminars may be worth 3 credit hours and will likely involve slightly more, but not an extreme, amount of work outside of class time.  Sometimes these course listings can be difficult to find in the [online schedule of classes](http://schedule.berkeley.edu), but a good rule of thumb when search is that they're typically numbered between 270 and 299 in whatever department is hosting them. The following are a few seminars that are popular among biostatistics students:

* PB HLTH 295 (section varies): Statistics and Genomics Seminar (%X% not offered during Fall 2014)
* PB HLTH 296 (section varies): Causal seminar / Semi-Parametric Models seminar
* CMPBIO 201: Classics in Computational Biology
* STAT 278B (section varies): Neyman seminar
* STAT 278B (section varies): Probability seminar

## General notes

* 12 or more units is a “normal” courseload for graduate students at UC Berkeley.  This is also the number of units a student must maintain to qualify for GSI or GSR funding.
* Classes actually begin 10 minutes after the start time listed with the registrar (students and faculty often refer to this as being on “Berkeley Time,” but the practice is not unique to UC Berkeley).

## High Performance Computing

### Biostatistics Compute Cluster

The biostat cluster is managed by Systems Administrator Burke Bundy. Please contact him to request an account and login details.  He is also an excellent source of information regarding the cluster and other computing issues.  His tutorials on cluster usage serve as the basis of the information presented below, with supplemental details added as appropriate.

The biostat cluster runs a popular grid computing job scheduler called Sun Grid Engine (SGE).  All processes that are executed on the cluster should be run through this interface.  Code can be run interactively or as a batch job.  To run processes interactively, use either the `qlogin` or `qrsh` command.  (For interested parties, the fine details of the differences between these two commands is explained in the [SGE documentation](http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/htmlman1/qsh.html).  For most purposes, either will suffice.)  After creating an interactive session with one of these two commands, proceed as usual, by, for example, opening a command-line `R` session.

To run code as a batch job, first create a bash script containing code that should be run in the shell, and then submit that job script using the `qsub` command.  An example job script, call it `example.sh`, might look like the following:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
#
#$ -cwd
#$ -V
#$ -j y
#$ -S /bin/bash
#$ -m beas
#$ -M your.email@berkeley.edu
#

R --vanilla < example.R > example.Rout
{% endhighlight %}

This script differs from a typical shell script because it contains options to be read by `qsub`. The example options above can be interpreted as the following:

* `-cwd` : Executes job from the user's current working directory.
* `-V` : Compute node on which job is run inherits your environment.  Omitting this may lead to the job script not being able to find installed software or libraries, etc.
* `-j y` : Error output from the job will appear in the standard output stream.
* `-S /bin/bash` : Specifies that bash shell should be used as the interpreting shell for the job. 
* `-m beas` : A notification email will be sent at all of the following points: at the beginning and end of the job and if/when the job is aborted, rescheduled, or suspended.
* `-M your.email@berkeley.edu` : The server will send notification emails to `your.email@berkeley.edu`.

Additional `qsub` options can be reviewed in [the documentation](http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/htmlman1/qsub.html). To submit the above script to a compute node:

{% highlight bash %}
$ qsub example.sh
{% endhighlight %}

After a job has been submitted, its progress can be reviewed like so:

{% highlight bash %}
$ qstat
{% endhighlight %}

A cryptic but important piece of information in the output of `qstat` is the one corresponding to the job state.  This column is labeled `state` and its contents can be interpreted as the following:

* `d` : a call to `qdel` has been used to initiate job **d(eletion)**.
* `E` : a job in **E(rror)** state couldn't be started due to job properties.
* `h` :  job pending; currently not eligible for execution due to a **h(old)** state assigned to it or because the job is waiting for completion of other jobs on which it depends.
* `r` : job is **r(unning)** or executing.
* `R` : job was **R(estarted)** because of job migration or for other reasons.
* `s` : job **s(uspended)** via the `qmod` command.
* `S` : queue containing the job is **S(uspended)** and therefore the job is also suspended.
* `t` : **t(ransfering)** indicates that a job is about to be executed.
* `T` : at least one suspend **T(hreshold)** of the corresponding queue was exceeded and so the job has been suspended.
* `w` : **w(aiting)** job pending.

One option for the `qstat` command that may be useful is `-f`, which causes `qstat` to display "full" or detailed information on running jobs:

{% highlight bash %}
$ qstat -f
{% endhighlight %}

To see only your own jobs:

{% highlight bash %}
$ qstat -u username
{% endhighlight %}

substituting in your own cluster login for `username`. The `qstat` command has many more options for customizing output which can be looked up in [the documentation](http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/htmlman1/qstat.html).

To delete a running job, run:

{% highlight bash %}
$ qdel job#
{% endhighlight %}

substituting in the job number for `job#`, which can be retrieved using `qstat`.

### Statistics Compute Servers

The statistics department manages several compute servers as well as a cluster.  Biostatistics graduate students are allowed accounts on the compute servers (but not the cluster); details on requesting an account are available [here](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/accounts).  More information on running your process on one of the compute servers is available [here](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/servers/compute).

# Preparing reports/reproducible research

## Basics

The most commonly used document preparation systems by UC Berkeley biostat students are $$\LaTeX$$ and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

### $$\LaTeX$$

$$\LaTeX$$ is a typesetting package and markup language which excels at displaying symbols and mathematical equations as well as allowing the user intricate control over the formatting of complex documents.  You can read more about its advantages [here](http://www.ctan.org/tex/).

There are many different ways to interface with $$\LaTeX$$ on your computer, potentially requiring some trial and error to find the best setup for your situation.  First, install a TeX distribution (or update the one you already have).  Options include [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) (cross-platform), [MiKTeX](http://www.miktex.org/) (Windows only), and [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) (Mac OS only).  Next, choose an [editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors). Popular, cross-platform choices are [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) version 2 or 3 with the [LaTeXing plugin](http://www.latexing.com/), [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with the [AUCTeX package](http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/), [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) or its fork [TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/).  Finally, be sure to have software installed that can read whatever type of document you compile to from $$\LaTeX$$ -- this is usually PDF but sometimes DVI or PS.

An enormous amount of [documentation](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Collections/LaTeX), [tutorial](https://www.writelatex.com/help/category/video_tutorials) and help ([1](http://tex.stackexchange.com/), [2](http://www.latex-community.org/forum/)) materials are available online for $$\LaTeX$$ users. A good way to get started is to customize a template -- howtoTeX.com provides a fairly sophisticated [guide](http://www.howtotex.com/download/FiveMinuteGuideToLaTeX.pdf) and [template package](http://www.howtotex.com/download/FiveMinuteGuideToLaTeX.zip) you can use to do just that. Also, writing even a fairly simple document with $$\LaTeX$$ may require calling on several $$\LaTeX$$ packages.  (More on a couple of those below.)  A few popular packages to keep in your back pocket are listed [here](http://www.howtotex.com/packages/9-essential-latex-packages-everyone-should-use/) and [here](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/553/what-packages-do-people-load-by-default-in-latex).

Some additional tools that may be handy when using $$\LaTeX$$:

* [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) $$\LaTeX$$ handwritten symbol recognition (also available as an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coolcherrytrees.software.detexify&hl=en))
* Online collaborative $$\LaTeX$$ editors:
    * [Authorea](https://authorea.com/)
    * [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (formerly writeLaTeX)
    * [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/)
    * [Papeeria](https://papeeria.com/)
    * [\Blue LaTeX](http://blue.publications.li/)

## Bibliography management

The most widely accepted way to integrate references into a $$\LaTeX$$ document is to add the references to a `.bib` (BibTeX) file and reference the `.bib` within the document's source.  However, there exist -- as with most things TeX -- many versions of this recipe.  Rather than going into those details here, we instead point toward some resources to get you started:

* A [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-9T2Oaj-5A) (based in writeLaTeX but applicable to a local TeX installation) presenting the creation of a simple bibilography in a $$\LaTeX$$ document and use of [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) as a quick citation generator. (Also note that [many reference managers support exporting citations to BibTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software#Export_file_formats).)
* A [more detailed introduction](http://www.andy-roberts.net/writing/latex/bibliographies), along with a reminder that sometimes [multiple compilations](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management#Why_won.27t_LaTeX_generate_any_output.3F) of the document will be necessary once citations are introduced.  (Some "smart" editors/compilation scripts may take care of these issues automatically.)
* For the interested reader, these responses ([1](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5091/what-to-do-to-switch-to-biblatex), [2](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib)) detail some of the intricate details of the differences between $$\LaTeX$$ bibliography packages and backends.

## Presentations

The most commonly used presentation-style package in $$\LaTeX$$ is [beamer](https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home) ([official CTAN page](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer)).  To get you started, here are a few (of **many**!) resources to look over:

* The extensive [beamer class user guide](http://mirrors.rit.edu/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf)
* A [beamer tutorial](http://web.mit.edu/rsi/www/pdfs/beamer-tutorial.pdf) from MIT, [another from UNCG](http://www.uncg.edu/cmp/reu/presentations/Charles%20Batts%20-%20Beamer%20Tutorial.pdf), and [yet another from NYU](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/politicsdatalab/latex/beamer_nyu.pdf), all chock full of examples (and presented using beamer!).

You will likely want to customize the look of your presentation.  To choose a beamer theme, the [beamer theme matrix](http://www.hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/) and the [beamer theme gallery](http://deic.uab.es/~iblanes/beamer_gallery/) sites may come in handy.  There are also [custom beamer themes](http://latex.simon04.net/) available.

## Posters

Although it may not be the "best" method for some users, it is possible to use $$\LaTeX$$ to produce a research poster.  Here are some popular packages/classes that can be used for that purpose:

* Packages included in most TeX distributions:
    * [beamerposter](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamerposter) ([additional documentation and examples](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/latexbeamerposter.php))
    * [tikzposter](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/tikzposter) ([additional documentation and examples](https://bitbucket.org/surmann/tikzposter/wiki/Home))
    * [a0poster](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/a0poster) (basis for `beamerposter` and `tikzposter`)
* Downloadable classes:
    * [baposter](https://code.google.com/p/baposter/)

## Reproducible research

The ability to reproduce a report from start (data) to finish (text, tables, figures, etc.) is made possible via the combined forces of R, $$\LaTeX$$, and an R library such as [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) or its predecessor, [Sweave](http://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/). Presentations can also be made reproducible in the same manner by using [knitr in beamer slides](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/beamer/).  Use of knitr is strongly recommended whenever possible!  Detailed documentation and many examples for using knitr are available on the official sites linked to above, as well as on the the [knitr R library page](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html) and in the 2013 book [Dynamic Documents with R and knitr](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781482203530).

## Theses and dissertations

The [ucbthesis LaTeX document class](http://math.berkeley.edu/~vojta/tex/ucbthesis-phd.html) is available from the UC Berkeley Math department.

Recent Berkeley Biostatistics MA graduate [Steven Pollack](http://pollackphoto.net/) developed an R package in May, 2014, which builds on the ucbthesis $$\LaTeX$$ document class and includes knitR and R markdown templates in addition to a $$\LaTeX$$ template.  The package is available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ucbthesis/index.html) and [github](https://github.com/stevenpollack/ucbthesis).

# General advice from current students

Prior to the start of the 2014 academic year, the BSGSA asked current Berkeley biostatistics graduate students for their honest answers on a few questions. These questions, along with summaries of students' responses, are below.

## What is the most important thing to know about Berkeley Biostats?

* Be proactive. No one is going to make sure you're doing what you need to be doing.
* Faculty and older students are willing to help. For example, "cold" emailing regarding thesis projects is completely acceptable.
* Don't be afraid to ask "dumb" questions. Everyone else is thinking the same thing.

## What is one thing you wish you had known about your coursework before starting?

* Biostatistics at Berkeley can be a stat-heavy degree. Students can take their electives in public health courses if they choose, but no one will force them to.
* Don't be afraid to try new things.
* Many courses are not as they are advertised, so be sure to shop around and ask older students for advice (or consult the course information on this site!).
* It's normal to take the minimum number of course hours required, which is 12 per semester. There is no shame in taking courses pass/fail.
* Graduate school is not the same as undergrad: the goal is to learn the material as well as possible. This is far more important than what grade you make (grades are less important than you might think!).
* Take the time to learn LaTeX, knitR, etc. sooner rather than later.
* Even if it feels overwhelming, just keep listening. The material will sink in eventually.

## What is one thing you wish you had known about graduate school life before starting?

* Take the time to take care of yourself. That includes your brain as well as your body.
* Find an outside activity or hobby. Exercise is great -- team sports are particularly good because of the social bonding aspect.
