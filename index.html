<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
<p>The Biostatistics Graduate Student Association (BSGSA) is a student organization at the University of California, Berkeley. Our goal is to represent the interests and needs of graduate students in biostatistics. We organize and secure funding for several social events each year, occasionally in coordination with other student organizations, such as those from Statistics or Epidemiology. We also provide support for student-centric events such as new admit visit day (in the Spring) and prospective student events (in the Fall).</p>
